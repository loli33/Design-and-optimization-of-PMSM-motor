# Design-and-optimization-of-IPMSM-motor
We have done a design of 10kW PMSM motor using MOTOR-XP software
Calculation of torque and power file is attached 
Steps:
  - Choose a reference vehicle
  - Obtain the specs of the vehicle such as dimension,weight etc
  - Calculate the required torque and power using 1 DOF analytical equations
  - Select the type of motor based on vehicle power and torque
  - Design a motor from MOTOR-XP software
  - Optimize it
